			Deciding you don't have much else to do, you just keep walking. The clouds remain to keep moving in ever-increasingly strange ways. No matter though, that doesn't concern you.

			Just a few minutes later, you spot a food truck in the distance! You are still hungry, so might as well see what they have to offer. You approach the truck, which seems rather familiar to you for some reason that evades your memory. Regardless, the owner seems a little nervous as you arrive.

				"Uh, why are you here!" he stammers.

				You look at him with a confused expression, "To get food?" you say. "Is there something else I should know about?" you ask him.

				"N-No! N-nothing to worry about!" he looks around sporadically. He visibly begins to sweat. For whatever reason, this dude is freaking out.

				"Okay, well I'm just gonna-" you're interrupted.

				"Wait, no! Stop! Just wait right there!" he blurts out as he reaches under his counter and presses something.

			Suddenly, those strange moving clouds seem to stop moving so randomly. One of them shoots across the sky directly above you and stops. You look back into the food truck and the owner is nowhere to be seen. Before you have time to react a beam of light envelopes your body and you feel like you begin to float, then everything goes black.

It doesn't take long before some creatures unlike anything you've ever seen enter the room. They are humanoid with blue tinted skin, their features are somewhat human, but have larger eyes, smaller noses, and their hair is replaced with what can only be described as tendrils.

				"Hello, human," one of them greets you. "We apologize for the inconvienence of this whole situation," she says.

				"Where am I? Why am I here?" you ask them.

				"Well, you are on our ship. We are what you would call an alien species, and we are studying humans. You are here because one of our newer recruits to our expedition team... let's say, completely freaked out and called us to him," she explains.

				"Sorry about that," another says embarrassed. "I was the person in the food truck. You 0ed asking questions and I panicked," he tells you.

				"Why?" you ask in response.

				"Well," the woman speaks up again. "We may have recently performed this maneuver on you before. As in last night. Uh... sorry about the tree. Our systems targeting system was slightly off," she says with a laugh... Well that makes a lot more sense now. "Anyway," she continues, "We feel bad about this whole ordeal, so we would like to offer you something as compensation before returning you to your home, and hopefully actually inside of it this time," she remarks.

			Opening it up, you view some strange looking items with a note attached. Withdrawing the note, you read:
			"Here is some food from our home planet. We have done the research to determine it is quite harmless to you humans. Enjoy!"

			Sitting down, you open up the bag and look in. A bright glowing light permeates from within. You reach into the glorious container and withdraw a delicious looking biscuit from its depths. The biscuit is magnificent, holding all of the wonderfull biscuity qualities you would associate with a magnificent biscuit.

You look behind the seats, under the seats, you check in the console, you scavenge the glovebox, you even crawl around in your floorboard for a few minutes until finally feeling as if you have exhausted all possible locations any money have been misplaced.

			You'd think you just accidentally murdered the franchise mascot or something with how they're acting. I mean, they didn't even give you a bag. Just handed you a solitary wrapped breakfast biscuit.

			You pull out of the line and drive back home. You exit your vehicle and enter your house where you go find a place to sit and eat. You unwrap your cold, slightly smushed (wonder who did that...) biscuit. It is in a sad state of affair. You didn't come this far to not eat it though. You raise the sad biscuit to your mouth and take a bite.

You've found a... half-eaten... bagel... oh no.

			Swallawing your pride, and any chances of not coming down with some type of serious illness, you grasp the bagel from the depths of its tin prison.

				"Okay, sure. But I already paid for that food... so wouldn't you be doing an injustice by stealing it from me?" you ask slightly confused.

				His face suddenly drops. A sudden downpour begins as the sky turns gray. Dramatic music begins playing from some unknown origin. He stares at the ground in disbelief. "How... how could I have done this?" He slowly walks towards you, his head in a hanging position the entire time. "Here. I- I'm sorry." He hands you the bag of your food as he passes by.

			You watch as the defeated man sadly walks by you. The cold hard rain dripping off of his Chiropteran-themed armor. You look into your bag for a brief moment to check if all of the food is still there, it is. When you look back up, the masked vigilante has vanished seemingly into thin air. No trace of him in sight...

You're no better than the criminal scum I've dealt with all night by trying to deprive me of the nutrients I need to keep up my strength. You will dealt with in the same manner..." He sets the bag on the ground and begins moving towards you... uh oh.

The fight is long and fierce, neither of you making any ground on the other... that is, until you spot your advantage. Glancing down at the peculiarly dressed man's cape, an idea sparks in your mind to take the upper hand. You let your guard down for just a moment, allowing him to land a few hits, but use this seemingly momentary pause in your combat to throw a powerful lunge of your shoulder into him. He keeps his balance rather easily, until his cape ends up under his foot. As he steps back to maintain his balance, you watch as he pulls himself to the ground due to his rather poor combat attire decisions. He lands flat on his back, hitting his head on the pavement as he falls. You waste no time in pouncing on top the stunned foe and begin wailing on him. Before long, the fight is over. The breakfast thief lay unconcious on the ground, and you move off of him to go collect your order.

This rather embarrasing beatdown of epic magnitude does not last long however, as he grows tired of using your squishy body as a pinata. He draws back his hand as far as needed, and comes forth with a devestating blast directly to your chin. You are knocked out on impact.

Staring at him expressionless as he enjoys the meal that was intended for you. He finishes eating the food and casually strolls away into the distance.

It was a pre-packaged item designed for a quick, albeit usually unsatisfying morning treat. Maybe you could try something else next time, or maybe you really enjoyed this easy meal. Regardless, your job is done.

			Congragulations! You had breakfast. It may have been unceremonius and frankly pretty bland, but hey, good job.

			You grab the pancake mix out of the cabinet and get it ready to pour. Carefully making three separate pancake blobs in your pan, you continue to carefully follow the directions that came with the box until they are finished. You remove the crispy golden delights and place them on a plate before adding any extra toppings and sweetness that you desire. Cutting into the tasty treat, you take a satisfying bite of your masterpiece before resolving to savour every bite afterwards as you enjoy your creation.

			You grab the pancake mix out of the cabinet and get it ready to pour. Unfortunately, you have completely misread the instructions that came with the box. Your rather... uninspiring intelligence has doomed your endeavor to end poorly right from the 0. You do your best to follow what you believed the directions to say before eventually finishing your "pancakes." You are left with 3 extremely dry, pretty burnt, and all-around displeasing to witness masses of what was meant to be pancakes. You poke one with a fork and take a bite...

			Oh no, that is absolutely atrocious! You feel your mouth immediately dry out from the abomination you recklessly entered into it. As a matter of fact, the pancake is SO dry that its absorptive capabilties do not stop. It sticks to the inside of your mouth and refuses to leave as it siphons all hydration from your body. What did you do to create this pancake of mass destruction? Will it be satiated with only your liquid provision, or will this vile creation move on to take over part of if not the entire world? Well, that is for others to find out, as your evil pancake invention has taken too much of your body's water supply to properly function. You collapse to the floor, lifeless, with a still dry and sticky pancake stuck to the inside of your mouth.

			You make your way around the kitchen collecting the items you'll need to prepare your food. You grab a skillet for cooking your food as well. You place your skillet on the stove top and turn it on. You carefully cook your bacon while keeping a close eye to make sure you don't burn it. You butter up your toast and do the same for it. Before long you have a delicious looking meal that would make just about anyone that enjoys well-made food's mouth water with anticipation. You slowly raise a piece of food to your lips before taking your first satisfingly crunchy bite.

			You make your way around the kitchen collecting the items you'll need to prepare your food. You grab a skillet for cooking your food as well. You place your skillet on the stove top and turn it on. You begin to cook the food without taking much time to look at how long you've cooked it and regularly failing to check how cooked your food actually is. By the time you've finished preparing the food, you are left with a plate of black charred items that seem to have the vague shape of what used to be bacon and toast. You raise one of these charcoal wonders of human creation (and not in a good way) and take a bite. Mmmm. Tastes like sadness.

			You take the milk and cereal out of the fridge and cabinet respectively. You go and grab a bowl, but before you get too far, you realize that this milk is actually out of date. That was close! Throwing that milk out, you open the fridge back up and take out the one you recently purchased. You pour the cereal in the bowl first (like a normal person...) and then fill it with some milk. You grab a spoon and dig in!

			The milk was so horribly out of date that your incredibly weak constitution just could not handle it. You can feel your body begin to shut down. The life slowly fades from your body as you glance towards the container that held your demise. The final thing your mortal body witnesses is the expiration date that lists several months prior. As you fade away, you can't help but think, "Why was that still even in my fridge?"...

			You are dead. Perhaps you should have gotten breakfast in a different way... or at least maybe you should work on that endurance. Yikes.
